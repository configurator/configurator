Hi, I'm Dor!

I've a software architect focusing on _developer experience_ and _code quality_.
I love doing the sort of work that boosts my entire team's velocity, which is why I love working on developer tools.

I'm currently working for AWS ElastiCache Redis.
In my spare time, I like messing around with Kubernetes.
I also really enjoy building existing tools from scratch, to get to know them better. 

I sometimes consult for startups, mostly on how to use a small time to make a lot of impact very fast.
Feel free to email me if you need some help.
